# automated-timetable-scheduler
An intelligent academic scheduling system that automatically generates conflict-free institutional timetables. It models real-world constraints such as faculty availability, theory–lab requirements, electives, room capacities, and workload rules, while adapting dynamically to changes like faculty leave or new sections.
