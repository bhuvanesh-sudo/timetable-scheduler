Capstone Project Topics and Engineering ExpectationsPurpose of This Document:This document provides the official Capstone Project topic list for the Software Engineering course, grouped into complexity levels to help teams select projects that align with their readiness and ambition. The purpose of the Capstone is to demonstrate deep engineering ability—not surface-level application development. Projects must reflect thoughtful design decisions, architectural reasoning, documentation discipline, testing, deployment, observability, performance analysis, and responsible implementation. Students are expected to deliver technically rigorous systems that address real-world problems and demonstrate innovation, ownership, and originality.Engineering Intent and Expectations:The Capstone represents a complete end-to-end software development journey, beginning with structured problem framing and concluding with a deployed, evaluated, and maintainable working system. The goal is to demonstrate serious engineering craft rather than UI assembly or template customization. Work that resembles cloning existing applications without original depth will not meet academic expectations. Every team must be prepared to justify architectural choices, assumptions, performance trade-offs, ML model usage where applicable, and security considerations.Team Composition and Deployment Requirements:• Teams must consist of 5 members.• All projects must be deployed to the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Render, Railway, DigitalOcean or equivalent).• CI/CD automation is mandatory (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).• Version control must reflect structured contribution: branching strategies, issue boards, meaningful commit narratives.• On-premise deployment is permitted only with strong technical justification.Sprint Review Structure:• Sprint 0 — Inception and Foundation: Problem framing, personas, epics and user stories, initial design and architecture, technology selections, deployment strategy, backlog initialization.• Sprint 1 — Core Implementation and Visibility: Approximately 40% working build deployed on cloud, initial testing results, observability setup, early performance metrics, sprint backlog progress visibility.• Sprint 2 — Completion and Validation: Complete functionality, testing coverage, performance justification, documentation, evaluation, public demo.Common Engineering RequirementsRegardless of topic, every project must:• Include architecture diagrams, UML models, ERDs, API specifications, and design justifications.• Provide meaningful testing: unit, integration, regression, usability, accessibility, performance.• Implement monitoring, analytics, logging, error handling, security, and privacy considerations.• Maintain documentation: deployment instructions, release notes, feature guides, design reasoning.• Provide performance evaluation, scalability justification, and relevant metrics where applicable.Complexity Classification• Low Complexity (L1–L5) — Institutional workflow systems, planning/coordination platforms, practical engineering with minimal ML or advanced security.• Medium Complexity (M1–M7) — Systems that incorporate AI/ML, real-time syncing, optimization algorithms, or domain-specific decision-support.• High Complexity (H1–H3) — Systems requiring strong security, compliance, cryptographicaligned reasoning, or distributed identity models.• Ultra High Complexity (UH1–UH5) — Advanced distributed systems, API observability, zeroknowledge security, real-time architecture intelligence.Low Complexity Topics (L1–L5)L1 — Intelligent Academic Planner and Learning Activity Optimization PlatformL2 — Campus Resource Reservation and Utilization Optimization SystemL3 — Indoor Navigation and Accessibility Assistance System for Large Institutional EnvironmentsL4 — Verified Lost?and?Found Tracking and Item?Matching System for University CampusesL5 — Smart Cafeteria Demand Forecasting and Token?Based Queue Optimization SystemMedium Complexity Topics (M1–M7)M1 — Accessible Language Learning Platform for Learners with Learning DisabilitiesM2 — Intelligent Ride?Sharing and Sustainable Mobility Platform for Urban Transportation Efficiency
M3 — Automated Timetable Scheduling and Faculty Workload Optimization SystemThis project involves developing an intelligent scheduling and academic workload optimization platform capable of automatically generating conflict-free institutional timetables while respecting real-world constraints. Rather than functioning as a static timetable entry interface or spreadsheet substitute, the system must model the complexity inherent in higher education scheduling—including faculty availability, program-level slot allocation, theory versus laboratory requirements, section groupings, elective overlaps, room capacity limitations, and institutional workload rules. The system should autonomously propose viable timetabling configurations, identify conflicts and resolution strategies, and adapt to updates such as faculty leave requests or the addition of new sections.To achieve academic and engineering rigor, students are encouraged to apply computational optimization or heuristic techniques such as constraint programming, graph coloring, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or integer linear programming to generate optimal or near-optimal schedules. The platform may support scenario simulation, workload fairness analysis, multi-criteria optimization (for example commute minimization or balanced daily distribution of teaching hours), and visual analytics to compare generated alternatives. Attention should be given to transparency, user trust, and explainability of scheduling decisions, differentiating the system from simplistic CRUD-based tools commonly found online.
