Final Project Roadmap.Project Roadmap: University Timetable Scheduling SystemStakeholders (The Actors)* System Admin: Sets up the "physical world" (Blocks, Rooms), manages system health, runs the schedule generation, and handles data imports (including who teaches what).* HOD (Head of Department): Approves faculty constraints, defines "Elective Buckets," and reviews the schedule for workload fairness (Auditor Role).* Faculty: Inputs availability constraints (subject to approval) and views their personal schedule.Epic 1: User Management & Access ControlGoal: Secure the system so only the right people can see or change data.Story 1.1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)Story: As a System Admin, I want to assign strict roles (Admin, HOD, Faculty), so that HODs only modify their own department's data and Faculty cannot change the master schedule.Tasks:* Configure User Permissions: Set up the system so that each role (HOD, Faculty, Admin) has access only to the specific buttons and data they need for their job. (Developer)* Secure Data Entry Points: Build "checkpoints" that verify a user's role every time they try to view or change sensitive schedule information. (Developer)* Protect Admin Accounts: Add a safety lock to prevent the accidental deletion of the main Administrator account. (Developer)Story 1.2: Secure AuthenticationStory: As a User, I want to log in securely using my institutional email, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive schedule data.Tasks:* Enable School Email Login: Connect the login page to the institution's existing email system (like Google or Microsoft) so users don't need new passwords. (Developer)* Keep Users Logged In: Ensure the system "remembers" the user securely so they don't have to log in again every time they refresh the page. (Developer)* Prevent Session Timeouts: Implement a feature that keeps the user's session active while they are working on long tasks, preventing data loss. (DevOps)Story 1.3: Activity Audit LoggingStory: As an Admin, I want to view a log of critical modifications, so that I can maintain accountability for schedule changes.Tasks:* Build a History Log: Create a digital "History Book" that records important actions, such as who changed a room or who deleted a course. (Developer)* Automate Event Tracking: Ensure the system automatically writes to this log the moment any critical data is changed. (Developer)* Verify Log Accuracy: Test by making a change and checking if the "History Book" correctly shows who did it and when. (Tester)Epic 2: Institutional Modeling & Data IngestionGoal: Digitize the college structure, student hierarchy, and constraints.Story 2.1: Infrastructure & Spatial LocalityStory: As a System Admin, I want to define Rooms and assign them to specific Academic Blocks, so that the AI knows where classes are located for travel calculations.Tasks:* Catalog All Rooms: Create a complete list of every classroom and lab in the system, specifying which building (Block) they are in and exactly how many students they can seat. (Developer)* Define Walking Times: Input the walking time (in minutes) between different academic blocks so the system understands travel constraints. (Developer)* Verify Room Details: Review the room list to ensure every room is correctly linked to its building and has the correct capacity listed. (Tester)Story 2.2: Transactional Bulk Data ImportStory: As an Admin, I want to upload CSV files for Faculty, Courses, and Teaching Assignments, so that I can map professors to courses in bulk without manual entry.Tasks:* Provide Downloadable Templates: Create standard CSV templates for "Faculty," "Courses," and "Teaching Allocations" (which maps Course_ID to Professor_ID) for users to download. (Developer)* Implement "Safe Upload" Check: Build a safeguard that rejects the entire uploaded file if even a single row contains an error (e.g., assigning a non-existent professor), ensuring database integrity. (Developer)* Test Error Reporting: Upload a file with a known error (typo in Course ID) to ensure the system rejects it and identifies the specific row. (Tester)Story 2.3: Student Section & Batch ManagementStory: As an Admin, I want to define Student Sections (e.g., "3rd Year CSE-A") and map courses to them, so that the scheduler knows which "Batch" of students must attend which set of classes.Tasks:* Create Student Groups: Set up a feature to define distinct student groups (like "Section A" or "Batch 1") and link them to the specific list of courses they need to take. (Developer)* Build Batch Assignment Tool: Develop a simple "Batch Manager" screen where Admins can easily click to assign courses to specific student sections. (Developer)* Verify Group Schedules: Check that assigning a course to "Section A" correctly makes it appear in that group's requirements list. (Tester)Story 2.4: Room Attribute TaggingStory: As an Admin, I want to tag rooms with specific attributes (e.g., "Computer Lab"), so that the scheduler doesn't assign a lab course to a standard lecture hall.Tasks:* Create Room Labels: Implement a system of "tags" (like "Has Computers," "Chemistry Lab," or "Projector") that Admins can attach to room profiles. (Developer)* Enforce Room Matching: Set up a rule that strictly prevents the system from placing a "Lab Course" into any room that doesn't have the matching "Lab" tag. (Developer)* Test Misassignment Prevention: Try to force a lab class into a standard classroom to verify the system blocks it. (Tester)Epic 3: The Core Scheduling Engine (The "Brain")Goal: The smart system that figures out the best schedule.Story 3.1: Fundamental Hard Constraints (Resource Clashes)Story: As the System, I want to prevent any double-booking of resources, so that the generated schedule is physically possible to execute.Tasks:* Prevent Faculty Clashes: Program a strict rule that makes it impossible for the system to assign one professor to two classes at the same time. (Developer)* Prevent Room Double-Booking: Program a rule ensuring that no single room can host two different classes simultaneously. (Developer)* Prevent Student Overlap: Program a rule ensuring that a specific student group is never expected to attend two different lectures at once. (Developer)Story 3.2: Complex Hard Constraints (Academic Rules)Story: As the System, I want to enforce academic structural rules for Labs and Electives, so that classes run as intended.Tasks:* Link Lab Hours: Program the system to treat lab sessions as "indivisible blocks" (e.g., if a lab starts at 10 AM, the 11 AM slot must also be reserved for it). (Developer)* Synchronize Electives: Program the system to force all elective courses in a specific "Bucket" to be scheduled in the exact same time slot. (Developer)* Test Academic Rules: Feed the system specific lab and elective scenarios to verify it respects these groupings. (Tester)Story 3.3: Soft Constraints & OptimizationStory: As the System, I want to score schedules based on "Quality of Life" metrics, so that the AI prefers schedules that are convenient for humans.Tasks:* Minimize Travel: Program the AI to penalize schedules that force faculty or students to walk between far-apart buildings in back-to-back hours. (Developer)* Reduce Awkward Gaps: Program the AI to avoid creating useless 1-hour gaps between classes, preferring compact schedules instead. (Developer)* Even Out Distribution: Program the AI to spread classes out over the week, avoiding situations like having 3 Math classes on Monday and none on Tuesday. (Developer)Story 3.4: Handling Unsolvable Schedules (Conflict Reporting)Story: As an Admin, I want to see a "Conflict Report" if the Hard Constraints cannot be satisfied, so that I know why the schedule failed.Tasks:* Enable Partial Solutions: Ensure the system calculates the "best possible" schedule even if it can't find a perfect one, rather than just crashing. (Developer)* Show Unscheduled List: Create a clear report that lists exactly which courses couldn't be scheduled and explains why (e.g., "Professor Smith has no open slots"). (Developer)* Verify Error Clarity: Check that the error messages are easy for a non-technical Admin to understand. (Tester)Epic 4: Advanced Workload Management & PolicyGoal: Ensure fairness and follow university rules.Story 4.1: Role-Based Max Load (Compliance)Story: As an Admin, I want to define strict maximum teaching hours per week, so that we comply with university contracts.Tasks:* Create Workload Settings: Build a settings menu where Admins can type in the maximum allowable teaching hours for different faculty roles. (Developer)* Trigger Overload Errors: Program the system to show a clear error message if a generated schedule tries to assign a professor more hours than the limit. (Developer)* Test Compliance: Intentionally try to over-schedule a professor to ensure the system catches the violation. (Tester)Story 4.2: Workload Analytics DashboardStory: As a HOD, I want to view charts showing "Teaching Hours per Faculty," so that I can visually verify if the load is distributed fairly based on the imported assignments.Tasks:* Calculate Total Hours: Program the system to automatically add up the total teaching hours assigned to each faculty member. (Developer)* Visualize Data: Create easy-to-read Bar Charts and Pie Charts that display these totals, allowing HODs to spot unfair workloads at a glance. (Developer)* Verify Chart Accuracy: Compare the charts against the raw schedule data to ensure the numbers are correct. (Tester)Story 4.3: Fatigue ManagementStory: As the Scheduler Agent, I want to avoid scheduling more than 4 continuous hours of lectures for any single faculty, so that we prevent faculty burnout.Tasks:* Program Burnout Prevention: Teach the AI to recognize "bad" schedules where a professor works too many hours in a row and apply a penalty score to them. (Developer)* Add Priority Controls: Allow the Admin to choose how important this rule is (High, Medium, or Low) depending on the semester's needs. (Developer)* Verify Break Insertion: Run a test schedule to confirm that the system automatically inserts breaks for faculty with heavy loads. (Tester)Epic 5: Visualization & ExportGoal: See the schedule clearly and share it.Story 5.1: Master Interactive TimetableStory: As an Admin, I want to view a "Master View" of the entire institution's schedule with filtering, so that I can audit the global schedule.Tasks:* Build Master Grid: Construct the main calendar view that displays the entire schedule in a grid format. (Developer)* Add Smart Filters: Implement dropdown menus that allow users to hide everything except the specific "Block," "Department," or "Semester" they want to see. (Developer)* Optimize Performance: Ensure the grid loads quickly and scrolls smoothly even when displaying thousands of classes. (Tester)Story 5.2: Drag-and-Drop Manual OverrideStory: As an Admin, I want to manually move a class with real-time validation, so that I can resolve specific edge cases.Tasks:* Enable Drag-and-Drop: Allow users to simply click, hold, and drag a class block to move it to a different time or room. (Developer)* Visual Conflict Indicators: Program the system to turn the block "Red" or "Green" while dragging, instantly showing if the new spot is valid or invalid. (Developer)* Prevent Move Conflicts: Ensure that if two admins are editing at the same time, one cannot overwrite a move the other just made. (Developer)Story 5.3: Public Schedule Export (PDF)Story: As an Admin, I want to export class schedules as high-quality PDFs, so that I can print them for notice boards.Tasks:* Generate PDF Tool: Develop a feature that converts the current schedule view into a downloadable PDF file. (Developer)* Format for Print: Design the PDF layout to ensure it fits perfectly on standard paper and is easy to read. (Developer)* Verify Output: Check the generated PDFs to ensure no classes are cut off or missing details. (Tester)Story 5.4: Explainability TooltipsStory: As an Admin, I want to hover over a scheduled class to see why the AI placed it there, so that I can understand the decision-making logic behind the schedule.Tasks:* Store Decision Logic: Save the AI's "thought process" (constraint score) for every class it places, creating a transparent audit trail. (Developer)* Create "Hover-to-Explain" UI: Build a simple popup that appears on mouse-over, explaining "Placed here to avoid travel penalty," helping the Admin trust the system. (Developer)Epic 6: System Resilience, Versioning & RolloverGoal: Keep data safe and manage semester changes.Story 6.1: Pre-Publish Integrity CheckStory: As an Admin, I want to click a "Verify Schedule" button that scans for double-bookings, so that I can be 100% sure the schedule is valid before publishing.Tasks:* Build Final Scanner: Develop a tool that scans every single slot in the finished schedule to catch any remaining conflicts. (Developer)* Create Visual Status: Design a simple summary screen that shows a big "Green Check" if the schedule is safe, or a "Red Alert" if problems are found. (Developer)* Stress Test: Intentionally create a conflict and run the scanner to ensure it catches the error. (Tester)Story 6.2: Automated BackupsStory: As an Admin, I want to have the system automatically backup the database daily, so that we can recover from server failure.Tasks:* Schedule Daily Saves: Configure the server to automatically save a complete copy of the database every 24 hours without human intervention. (DevOps)* Create Restore Button: Build a simple "Restore" interface that allows the Admin to reload a previous day's backup with one click. (Developer)* Drill Recovery: Perform a test where data is deleted and then successfully restored from a backup. (Tester)Story 6.3: Schedule Snapshots (Versioning)Story: As an Admin, I want to save multiple versions of a generated schedule, so that I can compare them before publishing.Tasks:* Enable Multiple Drafts: Update the system to allow saving "Draft 1," "Draft 2," etc., simultaneously without overwriting each other. (Developer)* Build Version Switcher: Add a dropdown menu to the main screen that lets users instantly switch between viewing different drafts. (Developer)* Verify Draft Independence: Ensure that making changes to "Draft 1" does not accidentally change "Draft 2." (Tester)Story 6.4: Asynchronous Job ManagementStory: As an Admin, I want to see a progress bar after starting the scheduler, so that the browser doesn't freeze during the calculation.Tasks:* Background Processing: Move the heavy schedule calculations to a background process so the user can still use the interface while it runs. (Developer)* Graceful Failure: Ensure that if the calculation crashes, the system updates the status to "Failed" instead of leaving the screen frozen forever. (Developer)* Load Testing: Run the scheduler with a large dataset to ensure the progress bar updates smoothly and accurately. (Tester)Story 6.5: End-of-Semester RolloverStory: As an Admin, I want to "Archive" the current semester's data and reset course assignments, so that I can start the new semester with a clean slate.Tasks:* Build "Archive & Reset" Workflow: Create a specific tool that moves old data to a "History" folder and wipes the board clean, making the system ready for new students instantly. (Developer)* Add Safety Lock: Force the user to type "CONFIRM" before deleting data, protecting the university from a catastrophic accidental click. (Developer)Epic 7: NotificationsGoal: Keep everyone informed.Story 7.1: Schedule Publication AlertStory: As a Faculty, I want to receive an email when the final timetable is published, so that I know when and where I am teaching.Tasks:* Connect Email Service: Integrate the system with an email provider (like SendGrid) to enable sending messages. (Developer)* Automate Announcement: Set up a trigger so that clicking the "Publish Schedule" button automatically sends an email blast to all faculty. (Developer)* Test Delivery: Verify that emails are successfully received by faculty members. (Tester)Story 7.2: Constraint Violation WarningsStory: As an HOD, I want to receive an immediate warning if I manually drag a class into a slot that causes a conflict, so that I don't accidentally break the schedule.Tasks:* Create Warning Pop-up: Design a pop-up alert that appears instantly on the screen if a manual move creates a problem. (Developer)* Explain the Error: Ensure the warning clearly states why the move is bad (e.g., "Warning: Travel time too short"). (Developer)* Test Real-time Alerts: Drag a class into a conflict zone to confirm the warning appears immediately. (Tester)Story 7.3: Deadline RemindersStory: As an Admin, I want to send automated reminders to Faculty to submit their availability constraints, so that the schedule generation isn't delayed.Tasks:* Add "Remind All" Button: Create a button on the Admin dashboard that triggers reminder emails to faculty. (Developer)* Draft Reminder Email: Write a clear email template asking faculty to log in and submit their preferences before the deadline. (Developer)* Targeted Sending: Ensure the system only sends reminders to faculty who have not yet submitted their constraints. (Tester)
